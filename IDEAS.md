# Behavioural types

* Based on polymorphic variants (Ã  la OCaml)
* Subtyped variant types are inferred based on usage
* Type-level duality
  + Structural duality (i.e. given the duals `I` and `O`, the dual of `type A = I Int` is `O Int` without being declared explicitly)
* The `-[...]` type allows for accessing the tags directly
* `_` in polymorphic variants to match against an unknown tag

## Session types example

```ocaml
type Start = [< Start]
type Api = O Start (R [ Ok (S [ Status (I Bool Eps)
                              | Uptime (I Int  Eps)])
                      | Err Eps])

(* `Eps` corresponds to the epsilon type (which ends a session)
   The `O` type is an "output" (i.e. sending a message), while `I` refers to "input" (receiving the message).
   `S` is selection (internal choice) and `R` is reception (external choice).
   The syntax for variants is partially based on OCaml's syntax, but no `of` keyword is used. *)
```

The code for `Api` corresponds to:

![Api](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%21%5Ctextup%7BStart%7D.%5C%26%5C%7B%5Ctextup%7BOk%7D%3A%20%5Coplus%5C%7B%5Ctextup%7BStatus%7D%3A%20%3F%5Ctextup%7BBool%7D%20.%20%5Cvarepsilon%2C%20%5Ctextup%7BUptime%7D%3A%3F%5Ctextup%7BInt%7D%20.%20%5Cvarepsilon%5C%7D%2C%20%5Ctextup%7BErr%7D%3A%20%5Cvarepsilon%5C%7D)

A matching implementation for the API defined above is given below:

```ocaml
(* client : Api -> Unit *)
let client ep =
  (* send : msg -> O msg cont -> cont *)
  let ep = send Start ep in
  (* branch : R ([>] as msg) -> msg *)
  match branch ep with
  | Ok ep ->
    (* select : -([> _ cont] as choice) -> S choice -> cont *)
    let ep = select Status ep in
    (* receive : I msg cont -> msg * cont *)
    let status, ep = receive ep in
    (* close : Eps -> Unit *)
    close ep
  | Err ep -> close ep
  end
```

## Resource type example

First, let's introduce the syntactic sugar for dealing with resource types. Like in Haskell, juggling around extra syntax that's a by-product of some (type)-safety (because of monads for State, IO, Maybe, etc.) sometimes becomes a hassle. In order to make code both more readable and writeable, there's special syntactic sugar for dealing with a single resource:

```ocaml
trace <var> with
  <exprs or bindings>*
end
```

which becomes:

```ocaml
begin
  let <var> = <expr> in
  let <var>, <bound-var> = <expr> in
  ...
end
```

For example:

```ocaml
let pointer = Pointer.alt 0 in (* Must alternate between reads and writes *)
trace pointer with
  let v = !pointer in (* ! is read *)
  pointer := v + 1;
  let w = !pointer * 2 in
  pointer := v * (w - 3)
end
```

desugars to:

```ocaml
let pointer = Pointer.alt 0 in
begin
  let pointer, v = !pointer in
  let pointer = pointer := v + 1 in
  let pointer, w = !pointer * 2 in
  let pointer = pointer := v * (w - 3) in
  pointer
end
```

Now with syntax out of the way, we can move on to some actual resource types.

To start with a basic example, we'll focus on a reference type (similar to `ref` in OCaml). However, 
we'll make use of some more powerful types in order to handle it as a resource:

```ocaml
module Ref = struct
  type Ref ty res =
    { value : ty } constraint res = [>]

  val ref : a. res. a -> Ref a res

  val (!) : a. Ref a [> Read cont] -> (Ref a cont, a)
  let (!) ref = ({value = ref.value}, ref.value)

  val (:=) : a. b. Ref a [> Write cont] -> b -> Ref b cont
  let (:=) ref v = {value = v}

  val (:=>) : a. b. Ref a [> Read [> Write cont]] -> (a -> b) -> Ref b cont
  let (:=>) ref f = {value = f ref.value}
end
```

Now using this for a basic example:

```ocaml
open Ref

val r : Ref Int [Read [Stop] | Write [Read]]
let r = ref 0

trace r with
  let x = !r in
  r := x + 1 (* Type error:
                  Value r : Ref Int [Stop] does not match
                  type Ref Int [> Write a]. *)
end
```

## Duality example

```ocaml
type Client = SomeClientType
type Server = SomeServerType

dual Client <=> Server

(* Given [cospawn : (client -> Unit) -> (server -> Unit) -> Unit
                    constraint server = client*] ... *)

(* Server/Client arguments represent the session resource that gets consumed *)
val myClient : Client -> Unit
let myClient = (* ... *)

val myServer : Server -> Unit
let myServer = (* ... *)

let () = cospawn myClient myServer

(* Given [spawnPid : (process -> Unit) -> process*] *)

let () = myServer (spawnPid myClient)
```

This duality serves in more complex tasks, such as when using session types.

```ocaml
(* Note that, by default, [Type*] applies recursively to types, but does not change anything not declared.
   For example, the tags of [cont] will remain the same after [cont*], but the types of the tags may
   be altered by pre-existing rules: a tag [A (I Int Eps)] will become [A (O Int Eps)] after the duality
   is applied. *)
dual I msg cont <=> O msg cont*
dual R cont <=> S cont*
```

# Proposed syntax changes

* Not a fan of `-` for tag-only variants, maybe `~` or `@` or something along those lines would be better?
  + Use `'` for the tags themselves, i.e. `'Abc` is a tag. Can be an operator too?
* It should be significantly easier to express session types/behavioural types than in other languages, but how can we get that? Type-level operators with unicode symbols might be a good start to getting more "math-y" definitions, but is that a real gain?
* `as` syntax in types is kind of wonky... should we have a better way to reduce ambiguity than parens?
* Should we accept single-line, Haskell-style comments (`-- ...`)?
* Is `Dual` a pseudo-type? Maybe we should have some other notation? What about `Type*`?

# Proposal v2

* Add a distinction between types and behaviours
  + `A` would be a type, with `a` as a type variable
  + `A!` would be a behaviour, with `a!` as a behaviour variable
  + Possibly use the `be` keyword to describe a behaviour?
* Certain operations are allowed on behaviours (but not types)
  + `A!*` (dual of `A!`), might need syntax changes...
  + `A! := B!` ("state change" from `A!` to `B!`)
    - In general, for a type `X A!` we would write this as `X A! := X B!`, where the _types_ must be preserved, but the behaviors can be altered
  + Types can have behavioural arguments -- can behaviours have typical arguments?
